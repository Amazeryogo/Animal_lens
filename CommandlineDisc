What is the command line for animal lens?
Command line for animal lens is a tool that helps you add more facts and features in your lens
 without interchanging everything in Python code .

What Coding language does it use?
It's own language! animal_lens_script(ALSpanda) is used in this command line.
 A word in ALSpanda is called a Bet(derived from Alpha-Bet) and code is called a Betsack
 (these are non-existent as most job can be done through 1 or 2 words)
Here are some really functioning bets:
.True                                            - for yes(or True)
.False                                           - for no (or False)
.Change((Fact))                                  - To change a fact( write a new one)(you have write .Open<filename>)
.GBTQW                                           - Go Back To Question Window.
>>C9<<                                           - To break code
$*$                                              - opens up Red Zone line ( you can write in english instead of ALSpanda)
